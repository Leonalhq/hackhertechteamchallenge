Create a quick and simple personal website or resume website that includes the following: introduction, education, experience, and skills.

Feel free to use whatever technologies and Front-End frameworks you feel most comfortable with. We have included on this repository a template personal website from Bootstrap. Please use this template as a reference, but go beyond this specific template. The hackathon dashboard uses RubyonRails, so try to incorporate that in your project if you can!

Please provide a detailed ReadMe explaining your project and how you made it (the languages/frameworks/tutorials/other resources used). 

This challenge will test your basic programming and web development skills, along with your creativity. We are not looking for perfection, have fun with this project and show us your passion for web dev!
